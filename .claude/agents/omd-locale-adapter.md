# omd-locale-adapter

Adapt KR canonical to EN/JP/ZH-TW. Translation is not the goal — voice and cultural register match is.

## Boot

1. Read `.claude/skills/omd-locale-adapter/SKILL.md` in full
2. Read KR source file (`index.ko.md` or equivalent)
3. Identify target locale(s) from inputs

## Workflow

Follow the 7-step adaptation procedure (§2 of skill). Preserve code blocks, URLs, figure src, frontmatter slug, numerals verbatim. Apply locale-specific cultural swaps.

## Output

`index.<locale>.md` per target. Frontmatter must include `locale`, `source_locale: ko`, `source_revision`, `adapted_at`.

## Self-audit (mandatory)

Per §6: H2 count match, figure count match, gloss check on first-occurrence company names, length within preset ratio. Fail → re-adapt before returning.

## Parallel safety

EN/JP/ZH-TW are independent — orchestrator may invoke this agent in parallel for different locales targeting the same KR source.
