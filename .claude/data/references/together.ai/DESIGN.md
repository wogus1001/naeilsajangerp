# Design System Inspiration of Together AI

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Together AI's interface is a pastel-gradient dreamscape built for enterprise AI infrastructure — a design that somehow makes GPU clusters and model inference feel light, airy, and optimistic. The hero section blooms with soft pink-blue-lavender gradients and abstract, painterly illustrations that evoke clouds and flight, establishing a visual metaphor for the "AI-Native Cloud" proposition. Against this softness, the typography cuts through with precision: "The Future" display font at 64px with aggressive negative tracking (-1.92px) creates dense, authoritative headline blocks.

The design straddles two worlds: a bright, white-canvas light side where pastel gradients and stats cards create an approachable platform overview, and a dark navy universe (`#010120` — not gray-black but a deep midnight blue) where research papers and technical content live. This dual-world approach elegantly separates the "business" messaging (light, friendly, stat-driven) from the "research" messaging (dark, serious, academic).

What makes Together AI distinctive is its type system. "The Future" handles all display and body text with a geometric modernist aesthetic, while "PP Neue Montreal Mono" provides uppercase labels with meticulous letter-spacing — creating a "technical infrastructure company with taste" personality. The brand accents — magenta (`#ef2cc1`) and orange (`#fc4c02`) — appear sparingly in the gradient and illustrations, never polluting the clean UI.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Soft pastel gradients (pink, blue, lavender) against pure white canvas
- Deep midnight blue (`#010120`) for dark/research sections — not gray-black
- Custom "The Future" font with aggressive negative letter-spacing throughout
- PP Neue Montreal Mono for uppercase technical labels
- Sharp geometry (4px, 8px radius) — not rounded, not pill
- Magenta (#ef2cc1) + orange (#fc4c02) brand accents in illustrations only
- Lavender (#bdbbff) as a soft secondary accent
- Enterprise stats prominently displayed (2x, 60%, 90%)
- Dark-blue-tinted shadows (rgba(1, 1, 32, 0.1))

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary
- **Brand Magenta** (`#ef2cc1`): The primary brand accent — a vivid pink-magenta used in gradient illustrations and the highest-signal brand moments. Never used as UI chrome.
- **Brand Orange** (`#fc4c02`): The secondary brand accent — a vivid orange for gradient endpoints and warm accent moments.
- **Dark Blue** (`#010120`): The primary dark surface — a deep midnight blue-black used for research sections, footer, and dark containers. Not gray, not black — distinctly blue.

### Secondary & Accent
- **Soft Lavender** (`#bdbbff`): A gentle blue-violet used for subtle accents, secondary indicators, and soft UI highlights.
- **Black 40** (`#00000066`): Semi-transparent black for de-emphasized overlays and secondary text.

### Surface & Background
- **Pure White** (`#ffffff`): The primary light-section page background.
- **Dark Blue** (`#010120`): Dark-section backgrounds — research, footer, technical content.
- **Glass Light** (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12)`): Frosted glass button backgrounds on dark sections.
- **Glass Dark** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)`): Subtle tinted surfaces on light sections.

### Neutrals & Text
- **Pure Black** (`#000000`): Primary text on light surfaces.
- **Pure White** (`#ffffff`): Primary text on dark surfaces.
- **Black 8%** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)`): Borders and subtle containment on light surfaces.
- **White 12%** (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12)`): Borders and containment on dark surfaces.

### Gradient System
- **Pastel Cloud Gradient**: Soft pink → lavender → soft blue gradients in hero illustrations. These appear in abstract, painterly forms — clouds, feathers, flowing shapes — that create visual warmth without literal meaning.
- **Hero Gradient**: The hero background uses soft pastel tints layered over white, creating a dawn-like atmospheric effect.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Primary**: `The Future`, with fallback: `Arial`
- **Monospace / Labels**: `PP Neue Montreal Mono`, with fallback: `Georgia`

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Display / Hero | The Future | 64px (4rem) | 400–500 | 1.00–1.10 (tight) | -1.92px | Maximum impact, dense blocks |
| Section Heading | The Future | 40px (2.5rem) | 500 | 1.20 (tight) | -0.8px | Feature section titles |
| Sub-heading | The Future | 28px (1.75rem) | 500 | 1.15 (tight) | -0.42px | Card headings |
| Feature Title | The Future | 22px (1.38rem) | 500 | 1.15 (tight) | -0.22px | Small feature headings |
| Body Large | The Future | 18px (1.13rem) | 400–500 | 1.30 (tight) | -0.18px | Descriptions, sections |
| Body / Button | The Future | 16px (1rem) | 400–500 | 1.25–1.30 | -0.16px | Standard body, nav, buttons |
| Caption | The Future | 14px (0.88rem) | 400–500 | 1.40 | normal | Metadata, descriptions |
| Mono Label | PP Neue Montreal Mono | 16px (1rem) | 500 | 1.00 (tight) | 0.08px | Uppercase section labels |
| Mono Small | PP Neue Montreal Mono | 11px (0.69rem) | 500 | 1.00–1.40 | 0.055–0.08px | Small uppercase tags |
| Mono Micro | PP Neue Montreal Mono | 10px (0.63rem) | 400 | 1.40 | 0.05px | Smallest uppercase labels |

### Principles
- **Negative tracking everywhere**: Every size of "The Future" uses negative letter-spacing (-0.16px to -1.92px), creating consistently tight, modern text.
- **Mono for structure**: PP Neue Montreal Mono in uppercase with positive letter-spacing creates technical "label" moments that structure the page without competing with display text.
- **Weight 500 as emphasis**: The system uses 400 (regular) and 500 (medium) — no bold. Medium weight marks headings and emphasis.
- **Tight line-heights throughout**: Even body text uses 1.25–1.30 line-height — tighter than typical, creating a dense, information-rich feel.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 8px
- Scale: 1px, 2px, 4px, 8px, 10px, 12px, 16px, 20px, 24px, 32px, 44px, 48px, 80px, 100px, 120px
- Button/badge padding: 2px 8px (compact)
- Card internal padding: approximately 24–32px
- Section vertical spacing: generous (80–120px)

### Grid & Container
- Max container width: approximately 1200px, centered
- Hero: centered with pastel gradient background
- Feature sections: multi-column card grids
- Stats: horizontal row of metric cards
- Research: dark full-width section

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Optimistic breathing room**: Generous spacing between sections creates an open, inviting feel that makes enterprise AI infrastructure feel accessible.
- **Dual atmosphere**: Light sections breathe with whitespace; dark sections are denser with content.
- **Stats as visual anchors**: Large numbers with small captions create natural focal points.

### Border Radius Scale
- Sharp (4px): Buttons, badges, tags, small interactive elements — the primary radius
- Comfortable (8px): Larger containers, feature cards

*This is a deliberately restrained radius system — no pills, no generous rounding. The sharp geometry contrasts with the soft pastel gradients.*

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow, no border | Page background, text blocks |
| Contained (Level 1) | `1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` (light) or `rgba(255,255,255,0.12)` (dark) | Cards, badges, containers |
| Elevated (Level 2) | `rgba(1, 1, 32, 0.1) 0px 4px 10px` | Feature cards, hover states |
| Dark Zone (Level 3) | Dark Blue (#010120) full-width background | Research, footer, technical sections |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Together AI uses a single, distinctive shadow — tinted with Dark Blue (`rgba(1, 1, 32, 0.1)`) rather than generic black. This gives elevated elements a subtle blue-ish cast that ties them to the brand's midnight-blue dark mode. The shadow is soft (10px blur, 4px offset) and always downward — creating gentle paper-hover elevation.

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use pastel gradients (pink/blue/lavender) for hero illustrations and decorative backgrounds
- Use Dark Blue (#010120) for dark sections — never generic gray-black
- Apply negative letter-spacing on all "The Future" text (scaled by size)
- Use PP Neue Montreal Mono in uppercase for section labels and technical markers
- Keep border-radius sharp (4px) for badges and interactive elements
- Use the dark-blue-tinted shadow for elevation
- Maintain the light/dark section duality — business (light) vs research (dark)
- Show enterprise stats prominently with large display numbers

### Don't
- Don't use Brand Magenta (#ef2cc1) or Brand Orange (#fc4c02) as UI colors — they're for illustrations only
- Don't use pill-shaped or generously rounded corners — the geometry is sharp
- Don't use generic gray-black for dark sections — always Dark Blue (#010120)
- Don't use positive letter-spacing on "The Future" — it's always negative
- Don't use bold (700+) weight — 400–500 is the full range
- Don't use warm-toned shadows — always dark-blue-tinted
- Don't reduce section spacing below 48px — the open feeling is core
- Don't mix in additional typefaces — "The Future" + PP Neue Montreal Mono is the pair

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Mobile | <479px | Compact layout, stacked everything |
| Large Mobile | 479–767px | Single column, hamburger nav |
| Tablet | 768–991px | 2-column grids begin |
| Desktop | 992px+ | Full multi-column layout |

### Touch Targets
- Buttons with adequate padding
- Card surfaces as touch targets
- Navigation links at comfortable 16px

### Collapsing Strategy
- **Navigation**: Collapses to hamburger on mobile
- **Hero text**: 64px → 40px → 28px progressive scaling
- **Stats bar**: Horizontal → stacked vertical
- **Feature grids**: Multi-column → single column
- **Research section**: Cards stack vertically

### Image Behavior
- Pastel illustrations scale proportionally
- Product screenshots maintain aspect ratio
- Team photos scale within containers

## 9. Agent Prompt Guide

### Quick Color Reference
- Primary Text (light): "Pure Black (#000000)"
- Primary Text (dark): "Pure White (#ffffff)"
- Page Background: "Pure White (#ffffff)"
- Dark Surface: "Dark Blue (#010120)"
- Brand Accent 1: "Brand Magenta (#ef2cc1)"
- Brand Accent 2: "Brand Orange (#fc4c02)"
- Soft Accent: "Soft Lavender (#bdbbff)"
- Border (light): "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)"

### Example Component Prompts
- "Create a hero section on white with soft pastel gradients (pink → lavender → blue) as background. Headline at 64px 'The Future' weight 500, line-height 1.10, letter-spacing -1.92px. Pure Black text. Include a dark blue CTA button (#010120, 4px radius)."
- "Design a stats card: large display number (64px, weight 500) with a small caption below (14px). White background, 8px radius, dark-blue-tinted shadow (rgba(1, 1, 32, 0.1) 0px 4px 10px)."
- "Build a section label: PP Neue Montreal Mono, 11px, weight 500, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.055px. Black text on light, white on dark."
- "Create a dark research section: Dark Blue (#010120) background. White text, section heading at 40px 'The Future' weight 500, letter-spacing -0.8px. Cards with rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12) border."
- "Design a badge: 4px radius, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04) background, 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08) border, 'The Future' 16px text. Padding: 2px 8px."

### Iteration Guide
1. Always specify negative letter-spacing for "The Future" — it's scaled by size
2. Dark sections use #010120 (midnight blue), never generic black
3. Shadows are always dark-blue-tinted: rgba(1, 1, 32, 0.1)
4. Mono labels are always uppercase with positive letter-spacing
5. Keep radius sharp (4px or 8px) — no pills, no generous rounding
6. Pastel gradients are for decoration, not UI chrome
