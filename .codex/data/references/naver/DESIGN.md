# Design System Inspiration of Naver (네이버)

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Naver's interface is the digital equivalent of a Korean newsstand at 7am — dense, utilitarian, search-first, and engineered to surface "the next thing you wanted to do" with one click. The page opens on pure white (`#ffffff`) with a single decisive accent: **Naver Green `#03C75A`** — a saturated, almost neon malachite that has become so synonymous with Korean internet that "녹색창" (the green window) is a generic noun for the search bar itself. Body text sits in achromatic grays (`#333` for headings, lighter grays for metadata), and the only sustained color a user encounters is the green border that frames the search input.

Naver does not chase the design-system-as-art-piece aesthetics of Apple or Stripe. The portal is intentionally information-dense: news headlines, shopping shortcuts, weather, stock indices, and service tiles all coexist above the fold, on the assumption that the user came to *do something*, not to admire a layout. Where Toss strips the screen to one task and Karrot keeps content warm and conversational, Naver fills the viewport — and trusts that a 26-year-old habit of pressing **녹색창** will guide the eye through the density. Typography defaults to the platform's native Korean sans (Apple SD Gothic Neo on macOS/iOS, Malgun Gothic on Windows), with Naver's own published faces (Naver Maru Buri for editorial, D2 Coding for developer surfaces, Nanum family for general use) reserved for editorial brand moments.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Naver Green (`#03C75A`) as the singular brand accent — the "녹색창" identity is non-negotiable
- Achromatic chrome (white background, gray text) so the green reads at maximum saturation
- Search bar is the visual centerpiece — green-bordered, oversized, top-anchored
- Information density over whitespace — many services, many headlines, one viewport
- Native Korean font stack (Apple SD Gothic Neo / Malgun Gothic) for body, with Naver-published faces for editorial
- Logo uses solid gothic-style capitals in Naver Green — never gradient, never line-art, never recolored
- Pantone 2270C / RGB 3,199,90 / CMYK 72-0-88-0 — official color spec across all media

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary
- **Naver Green** (`#03C75A`): Pantone 2270C / RGB(3, 199, 90) / CMYK(72, 0, 88, 0). The brand-defining color — logo, search-bar border, primary CTA, active-state indicators, "더보기" link accents. <!-- verified: navercorp.com/en/company/brandGuide, 2026-05 -->
- **Pure White** (`#ffffff`): Page background, search input fill, card surfaces. The neutral canvas that lets `#03C75A` carry the entire brand load.
- **Near Black / Heading Gray** (`#222222` ~ `#333333`): Primary heading and body text. Naver uses `#333` as the canonical body color rather than pure black — a faint warmth that reduces eye fatigue in dense feeds.

### Secondary / Service
- **Search Link Blue** (`#0068c3`): Search-result title links, navigation accents on `search.naver.com`. The historical "blue link" convention preserved for utilitarian information density.
- **Visited Purple** (`#6633b9`): Visited-link state on search results.
- **Ad Label Green** (`#00a83e`): Slightly darker green used to mark sponsored/ad surfaces — distinguishable from brand green so users can see "이거 광고" at a glance.

### Neutral Scale
- **Body Text** (`#333333`): Default body color, standard reading text.
- **Secondary Text** (`#5f6368`): Source attributions, timestamps, secondary metadata.
- **Caption Text** (`#767676`): Captions, fine print, breadcrumb separators.
- **Disabled Text** (`#999999`): Disabled labels, placeholder fallback.
- **Border Light** (`#dadce0`): Standard divider lines, card borders.
- **Border Subtle** (`#e9ebee`): Section separators, list-row dividers.
- **Background Fill** (`#f5f6f7`): Card backgrounds, alternate row surfaces.
- **Background Dim** (`#fafafa`): Section bands, tertiary surfaces.

### Semantic
- **Critical Red** (`#e74c3c`): Stock-down indicators, error states, breaking-news flags.
- **Positive Green** (`#03C75A` reused as semantic positive — Naver does not branch a separate semantic green, the brand color itself carries "up/positive" meaning in finance widgets).
- **Information Blue** (`#0068c3`): Informational links, neutral status.
- **Warning Yellow** (`#f5a623`): Caution labels, non-blocking advisories.

### Brand-color usage discipline
Naver Green appears on three roles only: (1) the brand mark itself, (2) the search-input border + search button, and (3) primary action accents (active tab underline, primary CTA backgrounds, "더보기" link color). It is never used as a hero background, never as a card fill, never tinted with opacity to "soften" — the brand book explicitly forbids gradient, line-rendering, color shift, and opacity adjustments on the green.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Primary (web body)**: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Apple SD Gothic Neo", "Malgun Gothic", "맑은 고딕", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, "Nanum Gothic", sans-serif` — platform-native Korean sans by default. <!-- verified pattern: typical naver.com / search.naver.com surfaces, 2026-05 -->
- **Editorial (Naver-published)**: `"Naver Maru Buri"` (마루부리체) — Naver's own serif/myeongjo-style face, used on editorial surfaces (long-form blog, brand campaigns, papers).
- **Developer surfaces**: `"D2Coding"` — Naver's open-source monospace (SIL OFL), used in Naver D2 (developer portal) and code snippets. Released by Naver 2016, based on Nanum BarunGothic. <!-- verified: github.com/naver/d2codingfont, 2026-05 -->
- **Public open-source family**: Nanum Gothic, Nanum Myeongjo, Nanum Square, Nanum Pen — Naver's signature gift to the Korean web typography ecosystem, freely licensed and widely used outside Naver.

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Display (campaign) | Maru Buri / System | 32px | 700 | 44px | Brand campaign hero, editorial titles |
| Page Title | System | 22px | 700 | 30px | Section headers on portal/SERP |
| Card Title | System | 17px | 700 | 24px | News headlines, shopping card titles |
| Body Large | System | 17px | 400 | 27.6px | Search-result body, blog body — `letter-spacing: -0.34px` |
| Body | System | 14px | 400 | 21px | Standard list rows, metadata-rich text |
| Body Small | System | 13px | 400 | 18px | Secondary metadata, attributions |
| Caption | System | 12px | 400 | 16px | Timestamps, source bylines, fine print |
| Search Input | System | 17–20px | 400 | n/a | The 녹색창 input itself — large, readable, no weight |

### Principles
- **Native first, brand fonts for editorial**: Body chrome uses the user's platform sans. Naver Maru Buri is reserved for editorial and brand moments — dropping it into list rows would feel mannered.
- **Tight letter-spacing on Korean body**: `letter-spacing: -0.34px` on 17px body is canonical Naver — Korean glyphs are visually wide, slight negative tracking improves rhythm.
- **Three weights cover 95% of UI**: Regular (400), Medium (500), Bold (700). Light is reserved for very large editorial display only.
- **Bold the headline, never the chrome**: Headlines in 700 to anchor the dense feed; navigation, tabs, and links stay in 400. The contrast itself is the typographic signal.
- **Korean punctuation aware**: Use `「 」`, `『 』`, `·` (middle dot for KR enumerated lists) where appropriate; never substitute Western quotes mechanically.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 4px (with frequent 8px / 16px multiples)
- Standard scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64
- Portal-home gutter: 16px on mobile, 20–24px on desktop
- Card-internal padding: 16px standard

### Grid & Container
- Desktop portal: ~1080px max content width (the historical Naver portal width — narrower than modern 1280px standards because vertical density beats horizontal sprawl)
- SERP: 1080px max with 220px right rail for related verticals
- Mobile portal (m.naver.com): full-width with 16px gutter
- Service-tile grid: 4-column on portal home (mobile: 4-col tighter), 5–6 col on desktop secondary surfaces

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Density-first**: A Naver portal viewport intentionally surfaces 20–30+ interactive elements above the fold. Users came to do a thing, not to "scroll through a hero."
- **Section bands** separate concerns: news / shopping / weather / stocks each get a horizontal band with 24–32px vertical breathing room between them, but tight 8–12px gaps within.
- **Centered alignment for the search bar; left alignment for everything else.** The 녹색창 sits dead-center as the visual axis; news lists, service tiles, and side-rail content all left-align off the left margin.

### Border Radius Scale
- 0: SERP table cells, search submit (flush green)
- 2–4px: Buttons, inputs, badges, news cards (default)
- 8px: Shopping cards, modal panels
- 12–16px: Service tiles, prominent grouped panels
- 9999px: Pills, chips, avatars

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow | News rows, list items, SERP body |
| Subtle | `0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)` | Service tiles, hover-elevated cards |
| Standard | `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)` | Dropdowns, autocomplete suggestions, popovers |
| Prominent | `0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)` | Modals, full-screen sheets |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Naver uses shadows sparingly and exclusively for affordance signaling — never for decoration. The portal is mostly flat (borders + background tints carry separation), and shadow appears only when something *moves* (autocomplete dropdown from search input, modal over content). The brand green never casts a tinted shadow — shadows are pure black with low opacity, keeping the green at maximum saturation.

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Naver Green (`#03C75A`) on the search-bar border, primary CTA, and active-state indicators only — three roles, period
- Anchor the search input as the visual centerpiece on any portal-style surface
- Use platform-native Korean fonts (Apple SD Gothic Neo / Malgun Gothic) for body chrome
- Reserve Naver Maru Buri for editorial / long-form / brand campaigns
- Use `letter-spacing: -0.34px` on 17px Korean body for the canonical Naver rhythm
- Show source attribution (`출처`, `By 작성자`, timestamp) on every news / blog card — provenance is non-negotiable
- Keep service-tile grids dense (4–6 col) — users scan many tiles fast
- Pair the green active tab with weight 700 + underline; color alone is not enough

### Don't
- Don't apply gradient, opacity tint, or line-render to the Naver Green logo or wordmark — explicitly forbidden in the brand guide
- Don't let the search input drop below 44px height — the 녹색창 must read as a primary surface, not a form field
- Don't use Naver Green as a hero background or large fill — it's an accent, not a wash
- Don't mix Naver Maru Buri with system sans on the same surface — pick editorial *or* chrome
- Don't introduce a second brand color — Naver is a one-accent system, full stop
- Don't strip source attribution from feed cards — it's a trust contract, not chrome
- Don't use pure black `#000000` for body — `#333333` is the canonical body gray
- Don't break the "search bar centered, content left-aligned" rule on portal-style layouts

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Mobile | <768px | Single-column feed, full-width search, m.naver.com surface |
| Tablet | 768–1024px | 2-col feed, condensed top bar |
| Desktop | >1024px | Full portal grid (4-col service tiles, news+shopping+weather bands), 1080px max width |

### Touch Targets
- Search input: 50–58px height on portal, 44–48px on SERP — always above the 44px touch minimum
- Buttons: 48px (large), 40px (medium), 32px (small)
- Service tiles: minimum 64px square hit area
- News card row: 56px minimum row height

### Collapsing Strategy
- Service-tile grid: 6-col → 4-col → 2-col as viewport narrows
- News + shopping bands stack vertically below tablet
- SERP right rail collapses below 1024px (related verticals move below main column)
- Top-bar service shortcuts collapse into a hamburger / overflow menu on mobile

### Image Behavior
- News thumbnails: 16:9 standard, 4px radius, lazy-loaded
- Shopping thumbnails: 1:1, 8px radius
- Profile / avatar: circular (9999px), 24–48px
- Brand-campaign hero: full-width edge-to-edge, no radius

### Iteration Guide
1. The search bar is the brand — if a Naver-style screen has no green-bordered search box, it's wrong
2. One green, three roles: brand mark, search frame, primary CTA. Never as a fill, never as a tint
3. Density beats whitespace — Naver layouts are supposed to feel busy
4. Native Korean font stack for chrome; Maru Buri only for editorial
5. Source attribution on every feed card — Naver is a portal, not a magazine
6. `#333` for body text, never pure black
7. Cards are mostly border + tint, not shadow — flat by default

## 10. Voice & Tone

Naver speaks like a long-time librarian at the front desk of Korea's biggest reference room: helpful, fast, slightly clinical, and absolutely not interested in marketing flourish. The voice assumes the user already knows what they want and just wants the friction gone. It uses everyday Korean (`-요`, `-입니다` mixed by surface — formal `-입니다` on legal/account screens, conversational `-요` on consumer feeds) and stays close to neutral verbs (`검색`, `더보기`, `로그인`, `확인`) rather than personality-loaded copy.

Naver does not try to be your friend. It tries to be the place you check first. Where Karrot leans warm-neighborly and Toss leans modern-minimal, Naver leans pragmatic-utility — it's the green window you've been pressing for 20 years.

| Context | Tone |
|---|---|
| Search placeholder | Single neutral noun or short prompt (`검색어를 입력해 주세요`). No personality. |
| CTAs | Verb-first Korean (`검색`, `로그인`, `회원가입`, `더보기`, `구독하기`). Imperative, never pleading. |
| Empty states | One factual sentence (`검색 결과가 없습니다` or with suggestion: `다른 검색어를 입력해 보세요`). Never apologetic, never illustrated. |
| Error messages | Specific and actionable. `비밀번호를 다시 입력해 주세요` over `오류가 발생했습니다`. |
| News card metadata | `출처 · 시간` — source first, time second, middle-dot separator. Always. |
| Account / security | Formal `-입니다` ending, factual, no emoji. The user is doing serious account work. |
| Service shortcuts | Bare service names (`메일`, `카페`, `블로그`, `지식iN`, `쇼핑`). No taglines. |
| Editorial / brand campaign | Allowed warmer, longer-form copy in Naver Maru Buri — but only on dedicated editorial surfaces, never bleeding into chrome. |

**Forbidden phrases.** `오류가 발생했습니다` (use specific cause), `잠시만 기다려 주세요` as a standalone (always pair with what's loading), `죄송합니다만` opening to error states, marketing-speak like `혁신적인`, `최고의`, `놀라운`. Emoji are not used in chrome at all — they appear only in user-generated content (블로그, 카페, 댓글) and in some editorial campaigns. Never in error messages, never in account flows, never on the search surface itself.

**Voice samples.**

- `검색어를 입력해 주세요` — search-input placeholder, the canonical Naver microcopy. <!-- common pattern across naver.com / search.naver.com surfaces -->
- `더보기` — universal list-expand affordance on news, shopping, blog feed. <!-- canonical Naver chrome -->
- `검색 결과가 없습니다. 다른 검색어를 입력해 보세요.` — empty SERP state. <!-- canonical SERP empty state -->
- `네이버를 시작페이지로` — hero CTA on portal home — turn Naver into your browser homepage. <!-- portal-home historical CTA -->
- `출처 · 1시간 전` — news-card metadata pattern (publisher name then relative time). <!-- canonical feed metadata -->
- `로그인이 필요한 서비스입니다` — auth gate microcopy. <!-- canonical account-flow copy -->
- `네이버에서 만나는 더 큰 세상` — illustrative brand line in editorial register. <!-- illustrative; reflects Naver brand voice on editorial surfaces -->

## 11. Brand Narrative

Naver was founded on **June 2, 1999** by **이해진 (Lee Hae-jin)**, a former Samsung SDS engineer (BS Seoul National University, MS KAIST), who in October 1997 had begun an internal Samsung SDS skunkworks project named **Web Glider** — a Korean-language search engine. The seven-person team launched its first service in January 1998 and spun out as **Naver Comm** with Samsung SDS seed funding. The bet was simple: the first wave of Korean internet was being indexed by Western search engines that didn't understand Korean morphology, and a Korean-built engine could win on linguistic accuracy alone ([Wikipedia — Lee Hae-jin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hae-jin), [Wikipedia — Naver Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naver_Corporation)).

In **July 2000** Naver merged with **Hangame Communications** (a Korean web-game company) to form what was renamed **NHN Corporation (Next Human Network)** in 2001 — pairing search/portal revenue with gaming cashflow. NHN listed on KOSDAQ in 2002 and graduated to KOSPI as Korea's dominant internet portal through the 2000s, repeatedly outranking Google in domestic search share — a rare feat globally. On **August 1, 2013** the conglomerate split: Naver Corporation absorbed the search/portal business and reverted to its pre-merger name; **NHN Entertainment** took the gaming business. The Japanese arm split in parallel into **LINE Corporation** (web/messaging) and **Hangame Japan**, with LINE going on to become the dominant messenger across Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand.

What followed was a decade of platform expansion: **Naver Webtoon** (the digital-comics platform that pioneered scrollable webcomics globally), the **Wattpad acquisition for US$600M in January 2021** to build a global IP pipeline, and **Naver Cloud** as the B2B cloud arm. In **August 2023** Naver unveiled **HyperCLOVA X**, a 204-billion-parameter Korean-first LLM, positioning itself as the **sovereign-AI alternative** for Korean and Asian-language users — a deliberate counter-thesis to GPT-4 / Gemini global generality. Naver CEO Choi Soo-yeon disclosed >₩1 trillion (~$3.8B USD) of AI investment over the prior five years, plus a hyperscale data center designed to host 600,000+ servers — Asia's largest. **Founder Lee Hae-jin returned as Board Chairman in March 2025** after years away from day-to-day operations ([KED Global — HyperCLOVA X](https://www.kedglobal.com/artificial-intelligence/newsView/ked202308240018), [The Register — Sovereign AI](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/08/naver_cloud_hyperclova_llm_sovereign_ai/), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/koreas-internet-giant-naver-unveils-generative-ai-services/)).

What Naver refuses: the minimal-search-page aesthetic of Google (Naver doubles down on portal density), the social-graph-as-product framing of Meta (Naver's center is search and content, not the friend graph), and the universal English/Western-default UX of global tech (Naver designs Korean-first, then exports). Naver Green became the brand's anchor not by accident but by repetition — for an entire generation of Korean internet users, the green-bordered input on the front page is the muscle memory of "going online." The brand book treats the green as something close to a logotype — explicitly forbidding gradient, line-rendering, opacity tint, and recoloring on the green wordmark. Naver-published typography (Maru Buri, D2 Coding, the Nanum family — released open-source under SIL OFL) functions as a public good: Korea's web type ecosystem leans on Naver's font releases the way the global web leans on Google Fonts.

## 12. Principles

1. **The 녹색창 is the brand.** Whatever else changes, the green-bordered search input on Naver's surfaces is treated as a logotype. *UI implication:* never demote the search input below the visual top of any Naver-style portal screen; never thin its border below 2px; never strip the green submit button from inside the frame.
2. **Density is a service, not a debt.** Users come to Naver to *do something*, often more than one thing in a 5-second visit. *UI implication:* a portal-home viewport should surface 20+ interactive elements above the fold without apology. If a redesign drops below 10 interactive surfaces above the fold, it has stopped being Naver.
3. **One green, three roles.** Naver Green is the brand mark, the search frame, and the primary CTA — nothing else. *UI implication:* if a design uses green as a fill, a wash, a tint, or a shadow color, it has drifted off-system. Reject or re-scope.
4. **Native fonts for chrome, Naver-published fonts for editorial.** The platform sans (Apple SD Gothic Neo / Malgun Gothic) carries everyday density; Naver Maru Buri / Nanum are reserved for editorial where the typography itself is a feature. *UI implication:* never mix editorial faces and system sans on the same surface; pick the surface's register first, then choose font.
5. **Provenance is non-negotiable.** Every news card, blog post, knowledge answer carries a visible source. Naver is a portal, and a portal's contract is that the user can always see *who said this*. *UI implication:* source + timestamp metadata is a required slot on any Naver-style content card, never demoted to a hover or detail screen.
6. **Korean-first, then exported.** Microcopy, font tracking, punctuation, line-height — all tuned for Korean. English / global versions follow, not lead. *UI implication:* design at Korean baseline (`letter-spacing: -0.34px` body, Korean punctuation, formal/casual register switch by surface), and adapt rather than starting from English defaults.
7. **Sovereign tech, sovereign UI.** From HyperCLOVA X (Korean-first LLM) to the home-grown Naver Cloud, the brand bets on building *Korea's own* version of the global stack. *UI implication:* avoid wholesale adoption of US-tech UI conventions when a Korean-native pattern works better — `즐겨찾기` not "favorites," `더보기` not "see more," `통합검색` not "all results."
8. **The brand is built by repetition.** Naver Green became iconic because it appeared in the same place, in the same form, for 26 years. *UI implication:* surface-level redesign is allowed; the search bar's color, position, and frame are not. They are the brand.

## 13. Personas

*Personas are fictional archetypes informed by publicly described Naver user segments, not individual people.*

**민지 (Minji), 29, Seoul.** Office worker in 강남. Opens Naver app first thing every morning to skim headlines (정치 / 경제 / 연예 — in that order), checks weather, glances at the KOSPI ticker, and saves a 카페 thread for lunch reading. Uses 네이버 지도 instead of Google Maps reflexively. Expects the search to know her based on prior queries; doesn't think of "personalization" as a feature, just as how it works.

**아저씨 (Mr. Park), 54, Daegu.** Small-business owner. Uses Naver as his only browser homepage — has done so since 2003. Searches `오늘 날씨`, `서울 → 대구 KTX`, `세무사 추천 대구` daily. Has never used incognito mode and would not trust a search engine that didn't show news + shopping + stocks on the same screen as the search box.

**현우 (Hyunwoo), 22, Busan.** University student. Uses Naver for 지식iN (the Q&A community older than Quora), 카페 (the persistent forum-club system that powers Korean fan communities), and 블로그 for restaurant reviews. Treats Google as the engine for English-language queries; Naver as the engine for everything Korean.

**Sumi 어머니 (Mrs. Kim), 62, Gwangju.** Retired. Uses Naver primarily through the mobile app — large text mode on, voice search frequently, watches Naver TV shorts after dinner. Navigates by the colored service tiles on the portal home, not by typing URLs. Loyalty is absolute: Naver has been "the internet" for two decades.

## 14. States

| State | Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Empty (no search results)** | Single line in `#333` body weight 400: `검색 결과가 없습니다.` Followed by a short `#5f6368` suggestion line (`다른 검색어를 입력해 보세요`). No illustration. No CTA. |
| **Empty (feed band, no items)** | One-line `#767676` 13px caption explaining why (`구독한 소식이 없어요. 채널을 추가해 보세요`). Never `데이터가 없습니다`. |
| **Empty (first-time user)** | Default state shows the public portal feed — Naver doesn't ship a personalization onboarding wall, the portal *is* the empty-state default. |
| **Loading (autocomplete)** | Suggestions skeleton: 3 rows of `#f5f6f7` blocks at 36px height, no shimmer. Resolves <120ms typically. |
| **Loading (SERP first paint)** | Vertical-tab bar renders immediately with cached labels; result rows render as gray `#f5f6f7` skeleton blocks matching final card geometry (16:9 thumb + 2 text lines). |
| **Loading (infinite scroll)** | 24px gray spinner centered at list bottom. No overlay. Existing rows stay visible. |
| **Error (search-side)** | Body sentence in `#333` 16px: `일시적인 오류로 결과를 불러올 수 없습니다.` With small text-only retry link in `#03C75A` (`다시 시도`). |
| **Error (network / blocking)** | Full-card centered message: `#333` 18px weight 700 title, `#5f6368` 14px subline, primary CTA `#03C75A` (`새로고침`). |
| **Error (inline form field)** | Input border becomes `#e74c3c` 1px, helper text below in red 13px (`비밀번호를 확인해 주세요`). One sentence, blameless, action-oriented. |
| **Success (login / save)** | Brief 2.5s toast: `#333333` background, white 14px text, bottom-center, no icon. Past-tense single sentence (`저장되었습니다`). |
| **Disabled** | Background drops to `#dadce0`, text to `#999999`. Geometry stays identical so re-enable doesn't reflow. |
| **Skeleton** | `#f5f6f7` blocks at exact final dimensions — thumbnail box, title line, source-meta line. No shimmer on portal home (resolves fast); 1.2s shimmer on slower SERP verticals. |

## 15. Motion & Easing

**Durations:**

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `motion-instant` | 0ms | Toggles, focus rings, color state changes |
| `motion-fast` | 150ms | Hover, button press feedback, autocomplete row fade-in |
| `motion-standard` | 200ms | Tab content swaps, dropdown open, modal fade |
| `motion-slow` | 300ms | Page transitions, full-screen sheet presentations |

**Easings:**

| Token | Curve | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `ease-default` | `ease-in-out` | The dominant easing — Naver leans on browser-default `ease-in-out` for almost everything |
| `ease-enter` | `cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1)` | Modals, dropdowns, autocompletes appearing |
| `ease-exit` | `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 1, 1)` | Dismissals — slightly faster than entries |

**Motion stance.** Motion at Naver is *invisible* — it should never be the thing the user notices. The portal is dense and fast; spring physics, overshoot, and elaborate stagger sequences are forbidden because they slow the user down. The autocomplete dropdown opens in 150ms with a flat fade; the SERP tab content swaps in 200ms with no slide; modals fade-in over a static backdrop in 200ms without translate-Y theatrics. The one place motion is allowed to be expressive is **brand campaigns and editorial micro-interactions** (e.g., 네이버 캠페인 page hero scroll-driven illustration), and even there the rule is "kinetic typography is fine; UI chrome bouncing is not."

**Signature motions.**

1. **Search autocomplete reveal.** Suggestions list fades in below the input over 150ms with `ease-enter`. No translate-Y. The list disappears on blur in 100ms. The input's green border does not animate — it's there or it's not.
2. **Tab swap (SERP).** Active-tab underline does *not* slide between tabs (Naver historically rejected the "underline-pill" indicator that Material made popular). The previous tab's underline disappears, the new one appears. Discrete, not continuous.
3. **Modal / login overlay.** Fade-in over 200ms with `ease-enter`, backdrop `rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`. Dismissal 150ms `ease-exit`. No scale, no spring.
4. **Reduce motion.** Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` all `motion-*` tokens collapse to `motion-instant`. No exceptions. The site stays fully functional — Naver was a fast portal before motion was a design discipline, and reduces gracefully.

Interpretive claims (editorial, not documented Naver statements):
- "The 녹색창 is the brand" framing in §12 — editorial reading of brand
