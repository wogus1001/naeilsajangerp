# Design System Inspiration of Yanolja (야놀자)

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Yanolja's interface is the digital equivalent of a Korean weekend getaway -- warm, energetic, and built around the simple proposition that **playing is the best thing you can do**. The home surface (now consolidated under the **NOL** consumer brand at `nol.yanolja.com`) opens on a clean white canvas (`#ffffff`) with deep near-black text (`#1E1928`) and the unmistakable **Yanolja Orange** (`#F54B1E`) -- a coral-leaning red-orange that sits halfway between a sunset and a hot pepper. This is not the corporate orange of fintech or the carrot orange of marketplace apps; it is the high-saturation, slightly-pink orange of leisure, of "let's go," of a discount sticker on a hotel banner.

The brand stack is built for a Korean leisure traveler in motion: thumb-zone CTAs, image-dominant lodging cards, prominent percentage discounts in coral, and category chips ("호텔", "펜션", "레저", "티켓", "특가") sized for one-handed scrolling. Underneath the consumer NOL surface sits a much larger group brand system (Yanolja Group / Yanolja Cloud B2B), but the master brand color remains constant across all of it. The system reads as **playful but not childish, dense but not cluttered** -- closer to a glossy travel magazine than to a utility app.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Yanolja Orange (`#F54B1E`) as the singular brand accent -- coral-red-orange, energetic, unmistakably leisure
- "Multiverse of Dreams" brand concept -- the symbol represents connection between travel and travelers
- Image-dominant lodging cards with prominent discount percentages in coral
- Korean-first microcopy with friendly `-요` endings ("어디로 갈까요?", "우리도 호캉스 갈까?")
- Mobile-first super-app architecture: hotels + leisure + tickets + live commerce + flights in one shell
- Clean white surfaces with warm near-black headings, no gradient-heavy chrome
- Discount-first information hierarchy: percentage badge before price, price before name
- 8px standard radius across cards, buttons, and badges -- not pill-heavy, not square-corner brutal

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary
- **Yanolja Orange** (`#F54B1E`): Primary CTA, brand accent, discount badges, active states. The signature coral-red-orange that defines every Yanolja and NOL touchpoint. Pantone 2028C/U.
- **Pure White** (`#ffffff`): Page background, card surfaces, modal panels.
- **Near Black** (`#1E1928`): Primary heading and text color. A warm dark with a hint of plum -- not pure `#000`, deliberately soft.

### Secondary (Brand Grays)
- **Light Sand** (`#F5EBE1`): Secondary surface, soft warm fill -- a brand-warm gray that pulls slightly toward orange in adjacent context.
- **Medium Gray** (`#8C8282`): Body and metadata text. Warm-leaning gray that complements the coral primary.
- **Deep Gray** (`#555055`): Strong body text, secondary headings.
- **Dark Gray** (`#1E1928`): Primary headings (same as Near Black).

### Discount & Promotion
- **Coral CTA** (`#F54B1E`): Discount percentage labels (`-45%`, `-86%`), live-deal badges (`라이브 단독!`), flash-sale tags (`플래시 특가`).
- **Coral Tint** (`~#FEEAE2`, derived): Soft promotional surfaces, brand-weak backgrounds for hero strips.

### Semantic (Inferred)
- **Critical Red** (`~#E5342B`): Error states, validation failures.
- **Informative Blue** (`~#2D8CFF`): Links and informational accents in body copy.
- **Positive Green** (`~#1FA873`): Confirmation states, "예약 완료" success.
- **Warning Amber** (`~#F2A600`): Deadline reminders, rate-change advisories.

### Surface & Borders
- **Border Default** (`rgba(30, 25, 40, 0.08)`): Card borders, dividers.
- **Border Strong** (`rgba(30, 25, 40, 0.16)`): Input borders, defined separators.
- **Overlay** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)`): Modal backdrops, full-screen takeovers.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Primary (Korean-first)**: `"Pretendard", "Apple SD Gothic Neo", "Malgun Gothic", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif`
- **Latin fallback**: System sans (San Francisco / Roboto) for English numerals and Latin captions.
- **Design Principle**: Pretendard handles Korean and Latin in a single metric, which keeps mixed-script lodging titles ("그랜드 조선 부산", "Premier Suite") on a stable baseline. No custom display face -- the brand uses weight and color, not a typeface, to establish hierarchy.

### Hierarchy

| Role | Size | Weight | Line Height | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Display | 28px | 700 | 36px | Hero promo headlines ("우리도 호캉스 갈까?") |
| Heading Large | 22px | 700 | 30px | Section headers ("인기 호텔 미리 예약!") |
| Heading | 18px | 700 | 26px | Card titles, list section headers |
| Title | 16px | 600 | 22px | Lodging name, primary list item |
| Body | 14px | 400 | 20px | Standard body, lodging description |
| Body Bold | 14px | 700 | 20px | Price (always bold), discount label |
| Caption | 12px | 400 | 16px | Metadata ("05.31까지", neighborhood, distance) |
| Caption Bold | 12px | 700 | 16px | Discount % badges, "라이브 단독!" tags |
| Micro | 11px | 500 | 14px | Legal, fine print |

### Principles
- **Discount-first weight rule**: Discount percentage and price are always weight 700; lodging name is 600; supporting metadata is 400. The eye reads `45% → 89,000원 → 그랜드 조선 부산` in that order.
- **Three weights only**: Regular (400), Semibold (600), Bold (700). No light, no extra-bold.
- **Korean-aware leading**: Line heights err generous (1.4-1.5) to accommodate Korean glyph density; tracking stays at 0em.
- **No italic**: Korean does not have native italic; the system avoids fake-slanting Latin fallbacks.

- Search bar: pill or 8px radius, large 48-56px height with location icon left, "어디로 갈까요?" placeholder

### Cards (Lodging / Activity)
- Background: `#ffffff`
- Border: none (image edge defines the card)
- Radius: 8px (image and outer card)
- Shadow: `0 2px 8px rgba(30, 25, 40, 0.08)` on hover, flat at rest
- Layout: image-top (16:9 or 4:3), title-second, price-row-bottom

- **Ranking medal** (top-5 lists): circular, gold/silver/bronze for 1-3, gray for 4-5

- **Category strip**: horizontal scroll under search, icon + Korean label, 56-72px tap target

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 4px
- Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64
- Global gutter: 16px on mobile, 24px on tablet, 32px on desktop web
- Card-to-card gap: 12-16px vertical, 8-12px horizontal in grids

### Grid & Container
- Mobile: full-width cards with 16px horizontal gutter
- Tablet: 2-column grid for lodging cards
- Desktop web (NOL): centered content, 1280px max-width, 3-4 column lodging grid
- Hero promo strips: edge-to-edge, no max-width, on home only

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Image-dense, copy-dense, chrome-light**: The brand sells leisure through photography. Cards must show a hero image at full bleed with minimal frame. Text below is compact, weight-driven, never airy.
- **Discount visibility is sacred**: A lodging card without a visible discount % feels broken. Coral badges always sit top-left of image at minimum 24px tall.
- **Korean text density**: Korean glyphs are wider per character than Latin. Cards budget for 2 lines of 14-16px title + 1 metadata line + 1 price line; never expand to 3 title lines.

### Border Radius Scale
- Micro (4px): Discount badges, small chips
- Standard (8px): Buttons, inputs, cards
- Large (12px): Featured promo cards, prominent containers
- Sheet (16px): Bottom sheet top corners
- Pill (9999px): Category chips, status tags, search bar in some surfaces

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat | No shadow | Default cards at rest, page surfaces |
| Soft (s1) | `0 2px 8px rgba(30, 25, 40, 0.08)` | Card hover, list-item lift |
| Standard (s2) | `0 4px 16px rgba(30, 25, 40, 0.12)` | Dropdowns, popovers, bottom-sheet |
| Prominent (s3) | `0 8px 24px rgba(30, 25, 40, 0.16)` | Modal dialogs, full-screen takeover |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Yanolja uses shadow as functional layering, not as brand expression. The brand's warmth comes from the coral primary and the photography in cards -- shadows are quiet, low-saturation, slightly plum-tinted (because the dark gray base is `#1E1928`, not pure black). Never colored shadows. Never inner shadows.

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Yanolja Orange (`#F54B1E`) for primary CTAs, discount badges, and active states -- and almost nowhere else
- Lead lodging cards with a full-bleed image -- the photo is the product
- Show discount % before price, price before name -- discount-first hierarchy
- Use Korean `-요` sentence endings in microcopy ("어디로 갈까요?", "확인해 드릴게요")
- Round to the 4px grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32
- Pretendard for both Korean and Latin -- never split fonts mid-string
- Keep card chrome minimal -- the photo carries the visual weight

### Don't
- Don't use coral for body text, dividers, or backgrounds -- it is reserved for CTA, badge, and accent
- Don't put two coral CTAs on one viewport -- demote one to neutral outline
- Don't use pure black (`#000`) for text -- always `#1E1928`
- Don't add gradients to brand surfaces -- the system is flat-color, photo-driven
- Don't use formal `-습니다` endings in consumer copy -- the brand voice is friendly, not corporate
- Don't drop the discount badge to "save space" on a promo card -- it is the entire reason the card exists
- Don't skin Yanolja Orange into a "Yanolja Pink" or "Yanolja Red" variant -- the master color is `#F54B1E`, full stop

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Mobile | <480px | Single-column cards, 16px gutter, sticky bottom tab bar |
| Mobile-large | 480-768px | 2-column lodging grid, expanded category strip |
| Tablet | 768-1024px | 3-column grid, search bar expands inline in nav |
| Desktop | >1024px | 4-column grid, max-width 1280px content, hover states activate |

### Touch Targets
- Buttons: 52px (large), 44px (medium), 36px (small)
- Bottom tab items: 56px height with icon + label
- Category chips: 32-40px height
- Search bar: 48-56px height (always thumb-friendly)
- Lodging card: full card is tappable (entire image + text region)

### Collapsing Strategy
- Search bar: full-width sticky on mobile, inline in nav above tablet
- Category strip: horizontal scroll on mobile, wrap to grid on desktop
- Lodging grid: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 columns as width grows
- Bottom CTA bar (booking detail): sticky full-width on mobile with safe-area inset; inline beside content on desktop

### Image Behavior
- Lodging hero: 16:9 on cards, 4:3 on detail, full-bleed crop
- Activity card: square 1:1 with 8px radius
- Discount banner image: edge-to-edge no radius
- Avatar (host, reviewer): circular 9999px, 32-48px

## 9. Agent Prompt Guide

### Quick Color Reference
- Primary CTA: Yanolja Orange (`#F54B1E`)
- Discount badge: Yanolja Orange (`#F54B1E`)
- Background: White (`#ffffff`)
- Heading text: `#1E1928`
- Body text: `#555055`
- Caption text: `#8C8282`
- Soft fill: `#F5EBE1`
- Border: `rgba(30, 25, 40, 0.08)`

### Example Component Prompts
- "Create a Yanolja lodging card: white background, 8px radius. Top: full-bleed 16:9 hero image with 8px top-radius. Top-left of image: coral `#F54B1E` discount badge `45%` in white 12px weight 700, 4px radius. Below image: 16px padding. Title 16px weight 600 `#1E1928` (max 2 lines, ellipsis). Below title: 12px caption `#8C8282` neighborhood. Bottom row: discount % in coral 14px weight 700, then price `89,000원~` in `#1E1928` 16px weight 700."
- "Build a Yanolja primary booking CTA: `#F54B1E` background, white text, 16px weight 700, 52px min-height, 8px radius, full-width. Pressed: `#D63E14`. Disabled: `#F5EBE1` bg, `#8C8282` text."
- "Design a Yanolja category chip strip: horizontal scroll, 8px gap. Each chip: `#F5EBE1` bg, `#1E1928` text, 13px weight 500, 32px height, 9999px radius, 14px h-padding. Selected: `#F54B1E` bg, white text."
- "Create a Yanolja search bar: white bg, 1px border `rgba(30,25,40,0.16)`, 8px radius, 52px height. Left icon: 24px location pin `#1E1928`. Placeholder `어디로 갈까요?` `#8C8282` 16px weight 400. Focus: 2px coral outline."
- "Design a Yanolja discount banner card: full-bleed image, coral `#F54B1E` corner ribbon top-left with `라이브 단독!` white 12px weight 700. Below image: heading 18px weight 700 `#1E1928`, subheading 13px weight 400 `#555055`. CTA pill bottom-right: coral bg, white text, 36px height, 9999px radius."

### Iteration Guide
1. Master color is `#F54B1E` -- coral-red-orange. Not pink. Not carrot-orange. Not pure red.
2. Discount % comes before price; price comes before lodging name. Reorder if reversed.
3. Pretendard handles Korean + Latin together -- do not split fonts mid-line.
4. Card images are 16:9 hero -- never crop to square unless it's an activity tile.
5. Bottom tab bar persists on mobile; use sticky bottom CTA on detail screens with safe-area inset.
6. Korean `-요` endings only -- formal `-습니다` reads as corporate marketing, off-brand.
7. The badge always wins -- if a card looks crowded, demote chrome, never demote the discount %.

---

## 10. Voice & Tone

Yanolja speaks like a friend texting you about a long weekend that just got 45% cheaper -- warm, casual, slightly impatient with hesitation, and built around the company name, which literally means **"Hey, let's play."** The voice assumes the user is already in motion -- already curious about Jeju, already comparing Friday-night rates, already thinking about whether to bring the dog -- and the app's job is to *not get in the way*. Korean copy lands in conversational `-요` endings (`갈까요?`, `확인해 드릴게요`, `가실래요?`) rather than the formal `-습니다`. English on group/B2B surfaces (Yanolja Cloud, Yanolja Group corporate) stays plain and aspirational -- *"Making dream travels a reality for anyone on earth"* -- not jargon-heavy.

| Context | Tone |
|---|---|
| CTAs | Verb-first Korean (`예약하기`, `지금 예매`, `결제하기`, `장바구니 담기`). Never `결제 진행`. |
| Empty states | Friendly nudge with a question (`아직 찜한 숙소가 없어요. 어떤 여행을 떠나볼까요?`). Never `데이터가 없습니다`. |
| Search prompt | One question, generous tap target (`어디로 갈까요?`). |
| Promo headlines | Conversational invitation, often a question (`우리도 호캉스 갈까?`, `로맨틱 데이트 완벽준비!`). |
| Discount labels | Loud, short, numeric (`-45%`, `라이브 단독!`, `플래시 특가`, `얼리버드특가`). |
| Error messages | Specific, blameless, actionable (`날짜를 다시 선택해 주세요`). |
| Success toasts | Past-tense, single sentence (`예약이 완료되었어요`). |
| B2B / Cloud surfaces | Plain English, aspirational, less casual -- the audience is a hotelier, not a couple booking a pension. |

**Forbidden phrases.** `불편을 드려 죄송합니다`, `오류가 발생했습니다`, `데이터가 없습니다`, `시스템 점검 중입니다`. Marketing-speak bans: `혁신적인 여행`, `차별화된 서비스`, `최고의 경험`, English boilerplate like `Best deals ever` or `Unbeatable prices`. Emoji are permitted in promo banners, category icons, and review surfaces -- never in payment confirmations, never in error states, never in cancellation flows.

## 11. Brand Narrative

Yanolja (야놀자, *"hey, let's play"*) was founded in **2005** -- formalized as a hotel-review and booking site in **2007** -- by **이수진 (Lee Su-jin)**, whose origin story is one of the most retold in Korean tech: orphaned as a child, he worked first as a **motel janitor** in Korea's love-motel industry, then as a manager, and in 2004 launched a forum site called **모텔 이야기 (Motel Story)** that grew to ~10,000 members. In 2005 he acquired **모텔투어 (Motel Tour)**, then the third-largest site in the segment with ~200,000 members, and used that as the seed of Yanolja. The thesis was unsentimental: Korea's motel and pension market was huge but stigmatized and opaque, and the operator who could **modernize the inventory and remove the shame** of booking a Friday-night room would own the next decade ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/18/yanolja-founder-started-as-a-motel-janitornow-he-is-a-billionaire.html), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Su-jin_(businessman))).

The product followed the thesis. Cards led with **photography**, not text. **Discount percentages** were visible before prices were visible. The brand color settled on a coral-red-orange (`#F54B1E`) -- not the carrot-orange of marketplaces, not the corporate orange of fintech, but a **leisure orange**, sunset-adjacent, calibrated to feel like a vacation poster. By **June 2019** Yanolja became South Korea's eighth unicorn after a $180M round led by **Booking Holdings + GIC**. In **July 2021** SoftBank's **Vision Fund 2** invested **$1.7 billion** at a reported **~$9-10B valuation** -- the **largest single investment in a travel startup** since the pandemic began ([Skift](https://skift.com/2021/07/15/softbanks-1-7-billion-bet-on-yanolja-is-largest-investment-in-a-travel-startup-since-pandemic-began/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-15/softbank-invests-1-7-billion-in-korea-s-yanolja-ahead-of-ipo)). Three months later, October 2021, Yanolja acquired a **70% stake in Interpark for ~$250M**, folding Korea's e-commerce-and-tickets pioneer into the super-app stack ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/softbank-backed-travel-tech-startup-yanolja-acquires-korean-e-commerce-company-interpark/)).

Yanolja then split itself into two strategic halves. **Yanolja (consumer)** -- now branded **NOL** -- handles B2C: hotels, pensions, leisure tickets, flights, live commerce, and the Interpark inventory. **Yanolja Cloud (B2B SaaS)** sells hospitality software globally; it acquired **eZee** (India, hotel PMS) and in May 2023 acquired Israeli B2B travel-tech firm **Go Global Travel (GGT)**, which distributes 1M+ hotels across 200 countries to 20,000+ partners ([PRNewswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yanolja-cloud-acquires-leading-b2b-travel-solution-provider-go-global-travel-enhancing-its-global-presence-and-technology-solution-offerings-301824499.html)). The group has been openly preparing for a **Nasdaq IPO** ([KED Global](https://www.kedglobal.com/corporate-restructuring/newsView/ked202408130019)). The brand frame for all of this is the **"Multiverse of Dreams"** -- the symbol "represents the connection between the travel industry and travelers digitally" -- with the mission **"Making dream travels a reality for anyone on earth"** ([yanoljagroup.com](https://www.yanoljagroup.com/brand_center)).

What Yanolja refuses: the **embarrassment economy** of legacy Korean motel booking (call-the-front-desk, no published prices, no photos), the **price opacity** of legacy OTAs, and the **stiffness** of corporate hospitality language. The voice is `-요`, not `-습니다`. The hero copy is `우리도 호캉스 갈까?`, not `프리미엄 호캉스 패키지 안내`. The brand insists, in its name and in its color, that **playing is not a guilty pleasure** -- it is the entire point. Coral is the accent because the brand is selling *the feeling of leaving on Friday*, not the feature list of a hotel.

## 12. Principles

1. **Coral is scarce, on purpose.** `#F54B1E` appears on the primary CTA, the discount badge, and selected/active states -- and almost nowhere else. It never tints a card background, never decorates a divider. *UI implication:* at most one coral CTA per viewport in the primary flow; if two compete, demote one to neutral outline. The discount badge is exempt -- multiple discount badges per viewport are normal because they belong to *cards*, not to *flow*.
2. **Discount-first information hierarchy.** On a lodging card the eye reads `45% → 89,000원 → 그랜드 조선 부산 → 부산 해운대` in that order, enforced by weight (700 → 700 → 600 → 400) and color (coral → black → black → gray). *UI implication:* never demote the discount % below the title to "improve aesthetics"; the badge is the reason the card converts.
3. **Photography is the product.** Lodging cards are image-led at 16:9. Activity cards are image-led at 1:1. The text region exists to confirm what the photograph already promised. *UI implication:* never insert a heavy text panel above the hero image; never swap the hero image for an icon.
4. **`-요`, never `-습니다`.** The consumer brand is a friend, not a vendor. Korean sentences end in conversational `-요` endings throughout the consumer surface (NOL, Yanolja app). Formal `-습니다` is reserved for legal text, ToS, and B2B Cloud surfaces. *UI implication:* if a screen of consumer copy contains `-습니다`, it has drifted into corporate register -- rewrite.
5. **Korean glyph density is a layout constraint.** Korean characters are wider per-glyph than Latin, and titles routinely run to 16-20 characters. Cards must accommodate 2 lines of 14-16px Korean title without ellipsizing the brand name. *UI implication:* card title slot budgets for 2 lines and ellipsizes on line 3 -- never on line 2.
6. **One color system, two surfaces.** Consumer (NOL / Yanolja) and B2B (Yanolja Cloud) share the same `#F54B1E` master and the same brand grays, but consumer leans **playful + image-dense + Korean -요** and B2B leans **clean + data-dense + plain English**. *UI implication:* if you are styling a Yanolja Cloud dashboard, keep the coral but quiet the photography; if you are styling a NOL listing card, keep the coral and let the photography lead.
7. **Discount badges are sacred geometry.** Top-left of image, coral background, white text, weight 700, 4-6px radius, never less than 24px tall. *UI implication:* if a localized translation overflows the badge, change the layout, not the geometry.
8. **The brand promises play, not luxury.** Yanolja does not present itself as a luxury concierge (Banyan Tree, Aman) or a price-aggregator commodity (Trivago). It promises the energy of a long weekend, the relief of a discount, the warmth of a friend who already booked. *UI implication:* avoid both luxury cues (gold accents, serif typefaces, full-bleed cinematic blacks) and discount-aggregator cues (yellow alarm bars, comparison-table chrome). Stay in the leisure-magazine middle.

## 13. Personas

*Personas are fictional archetypes informed by publicly described Yanolja user segments, not individual people.*

**서연 (Seo-yeon), 28, Seoul.** Marketing manager in 강남구. Books a 호캉스 (hotel-staycation) every 6-8 weeks with her boyfriend -- usually a Friday-night downtown 5-star at 40-60% off. Opens NOL on the subway home Wednesday, filters by `오늘-내일`, sorts by discount. Will pay extra for a city view and a late checkout; will not tolerate a card without a photo.

**민준 (Min-jun), 34, Daegu.** Married, two kids under 8. Books a pension or kids-pool resort every long weekend (어린이날, 추석 연휴). Cares more about kids' amenities and parking than about discount %. Reads every review. Treats the chat-with-host feature as essential, not optional.

**Sarah, 31, Singapore.** Visits Korea twice a year for K-pop concerts and food tourism. Uses NOL for hotel + Interpark for concert tickets and finds it convenient that the same login covers both. Wants English UI but is fine with Korean photos and venue names; expects credit-card billing with no surprise FX fees.

**호스트 박사장님 (Mr. Park), 52, Gangwon.** Runs a 12-room pension on the East Sea. Yanolja Cloud user -- the calendar, pricing, and channel-manager screens are his daily UI, not the consumer app. Cares about reliable double-booking prevention, fast payout settlement, and a Korean-speaking support line. Reads English screens slowly; prefers Korean throughout.

## 14. States

| State | Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Empty (no saved 찜)** | One-line warm prompt (`아직 찜한 숙소가 없어요. 어떤 여행을 떠나볼까요?`) + primary CTA `둘러보기` in coral. Never an illustration filling the screen. |
| **Empty (no search results)** | Single line of `#8C8282` body (`조건에 맞는 숙소가 없어요. 날짜를 바꿔볼까요?`) + secondary outline CTA `날짜 변경`. |
| **Empty (sold out for selected dates)** | Inline soft fallback (`다른 날짜 확인`) directly inside the affected card -- not a full-screen state. The card stays, the price slot becomes the link. |
| **Loading (first paint)** | Skeleton blocks at `#F5EBE1` matching the lodging-card layout -- 16:9 image box, 1 title line, 1 metadata line, 1 price line. Shimmer at 1.2s with 8% white highlight. |
| **Loading (infinite scroll)** | Bottom-of-list spinner in coral `#F54B1E`, 24px diameter. Existing cards stay visible. |
| **Loading (booking submission)** | Full-screen overlay with coral spinner + status copy (`예약을 확정하고 있어요`). Never auto-dismiss; wait for server. |
| **Error (inline field)** | Border becomes `~#E5342B` 2px, helper text below in critical-red 13px (`날짜를 다시 선택해 주세요`). |
| **Error (toast)** | `#1E1928` bg, white 14px weight 400 text, 3s auto-dismiss. Bottom of screen, 16px above tab bar. One sentence. |
| **Error (payment failure)** | Dedicated screen, not a toast. Critical-red icon top, one-line cause (`결제가 처리되지 않았어요`), one-line guidance (`다른 카드를 시도해 보시겠어요?`), primary CTA `다시 시도하기` in coral. |
| **Success (favorite added)** | Brief 200ms coral heart animation + toast `찜 목록에 담았어요`. |
| **Success (booking complete)** | Dedicated confirmation screen. Coral check icon top, one-line past-tense sentence (`예약이 완료되었어요`), reservation summary card, primary `예약 내역 보기`. Never a toast for a paid booking. |
| **Skeleton** | `#F5EBE1` blocks at exact card dimensions. Discount-badge slot stays blank until resolved -- never a placeholder %. |
| **Disabled** | Button bg drops to `#F5EBE1`, text to `#8C8282`. Geometry stays identical to enabled state for frame stability. |

## 15. Motion & Easing

**Durations** (named tokens):

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `motion-instant` | 0ms | Toggle flips, checkbox state changes |
| `motion-fast` | 150ms | Hover, focus, button press, inline favorite flash |
| `motion-standard` | 240ms | Card taps, tab switches, bottom-sheet reveal |
| `motion-slow` | 360ms | Booking confirmation reveal, full-sheet presentations |
| `motion-page` | 280ms | Push/pop between routes |

**Easings:**

| Token | Curve | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `ease-enter` | `cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1)` | Sheets, toasts, screens entering |
| `ease-exit` | `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 1, 1)` | Dismissals, pops, toast auto-close |
| `ease-standard` | `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)` | Two-way transitions -- expandable cards, tab content |

**Spring stance.** Light, controlled spring is **permitted on playful interactions** -- the favorite-heart bounce, the category-chip selection pop, the discount-badge enter on first paint -- because the brand is leisure and the name literally means "let's play." But spring is **forbidden on payment, cancellation, and error surfaces** -- bouncing a `결제하기` button reads as toy-like, and overshooting a refund confirmation looks irresponsible. Spring stays in the consumer-discovery layer; it never enters the money layer.

**Signature motions.**

1. **Lodging-card tap.** Card compresses to 97% scale on press (`motion-fast / ease-standard`), releases on tap-up before navigation begins. Route transition then runs `motion-page / ease-enter` with a 16px upward push.
2. **Discount-badge enter.** On first card paint, the coral discount badge scales from 0.85 → 1.0 with a soft spring (stiffness 180, damping 18) over `motion-standard`. The price slot fades in 80ms after, so the eye reads the % first.
3. **Favorite (찜) heart.** Tap triggers a coral `#F54B1E` heart that scales 1.0 → 1.25 → 1.0 with spring (stiffness 220, damping 14) over `motion-fast`. A toast slides in from bottom on `motion-standard / ease-enter`.
4. **Bottom-sheet (date picker, region picker).** Sheet rises from `y+40px` with `motion-standard / ease-enter`; backdrop fades to `rgba(0,0,0,0.6)`. Dismissal is `motion-fast / ease-exit` -- leaving is lighter than entering.
5. **Reduce motion.** Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, all `motion-*` tokens collapse to `motion-instant`. Spring on hearts and badges is replaced with instant scale. Cross-fade replaces slide. The app stays fully usable; just less kinetic.

  official Yanolja disclosure. Re-verify before quoting publicly.
- The funding ladder (Skylake 60B, AJU IB 21B, Hanwha 30B, GIC+Booking $180M,

Personas (§13) are fictional archetypes informed by publicly described
Yanolja user segments (KR urban 호캉스 user, KR family pension user,
international concert/food tourist via Interpark cross-sell, KR pension
operator on Yanolja Cloud). Any resemblance to specific individuals is
unintended.

Interpretive claims (editorial, not documented Yanolja statements):
- "Coral leisure orange, sunset-adjacent" framing in §1 and §11 -- editorial
  reading of the verified #F54B1E primary, not a sourced brand statement.
- "Embarrassment economy of legacy Korean motel booking" in §11 closing --
  editorial framing of the founding thesis based on published founder
  interviews, not a direct Yanolja quote.
- The spring-permitted-on-discovery / spring-forbidden-on-money stance in
  §15 -- derived from the brand's own playful-name + leisure-positioning
  posture; not a documented motion-system rule.
- The "-요 vs -습니다" register split between consumer NOL and B2B Yanolja
  Cloud is observed across surfaces but not codified in a published voice
  guide.
